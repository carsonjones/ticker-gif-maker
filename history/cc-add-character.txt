⏺ Let me check the animator to see where characters are defined:

⏺ Read(src/animator.ts)
  ⎿  Read 336 lines

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*text-engine*")

⏺ Read(src/text-engine.ts)
  ⎿  Read 155 lines

⏺ Update(fonts/block.json)

      42      "!": ["█", "█", "█", " ", "█"],

      45 -    "_": ["     ", "     ", "     ", "     ", "█████"]         
      45 +    "_": ["     ", "     ", "     ", "     ", "█████"],        
      46 +    "'": ["█", "█", " ", " ", " "]                             
      47    }                                                            
      48  }
